# Current Task

## ✅ COMPLETED: Complete UI Overhaul - Make it Agentic & Modern

**Status**: ✅ Complete (Nov 29, 2025)

**User Feedback**: "This looks so basic, not like a platform that's agentic and friendly. I don't see the copilot, can't change account or business manager easily."

### What Was Fixed:
1. ✅ **UI modernized** - Premium dark theme with gradients and modern aesthetics
2. ✅ **AI Copilot always visible** - Permanently pinned right sidebar with chat
3. ✅ **Agentic feel** - Quick actions, conversation starters, AI insights banner
4. ✅ **Account switching improved** - Prominent dropdown in sidebar with search

### Components Created:
- `ModernSidebar.tsx` - Premium dark navigation sidebar
- `ModernAccountSwitcher.tsx` - Account/BM dropdown with search
- `AIChat.tsx` - Always-visible AI Copilot panel
- `QuickActions.tsx` - AI quick action buttons
- `ChatWelcome.tsx` - Welcoming chat interface
