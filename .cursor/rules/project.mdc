# Meta Ads AI Agent - Cursor Rules

## CRITICAL: Start of Every Chat

**BEFORE doing anything else, you MUST:**

1. Read `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Understand the project vision and architecture
2. Read `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` - See what's actively being worked on
3. Read `docs/HANDOVER.md` - Get context from previous chat (if exists)
4. Read `docs/DECISIONS.md` - Know past technical choices
5. Read `docs/LEARNINGS.md` - Avoid known pitfalls

**Then announce:** "I've read the context files. Continuing from [current task]. Previous progress: [summary]."

---

## CRITICAL: Context Engineering Workflow (ALWAYS FOLLOW)

### When User Says "Add X" or "Fix Y" or Any New Task

**IMMEDIATELY before starting work:**
1. Update `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` → Add the new task as "🔄 In Progress"
2. Then do the actual work (code changes)

**AFTER completing the work:**
1. Update `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` → Mark task as "✅ Complete"
2. Update `docs/PROGRESS.md` → Log files created/modified
3. Update `docs/DECISIONS.md` → If you made any architectural choices
4. Update `docs/LEARNINGS.md` → If you discovered any gotchas
5. Update `docs/HANDOVER.md` → Keep it current with latest state

### After EVERY Task Completion (No Exceptions)

```
Task Done → Update These Docs:
├── CURRENT_TASK.md   (mark complete, add next task if any)
├── PROGRESS.md       (log what was done, files changed)
├── HANDOVER.md       (update current state for next chat)
├── DECISIONS.md      (if architectural choices were made)
├── LEARNINGS.md      (if gotchas were discovered)
└── DEPLOY TO VERCEL  (run: npx vercel --prod --yes)
```

### CRITICAL: Deploy to Vercel After Task Completion

**After completing ANY task that modifies code, ALWAYS deploy to Vercel:**

```bash
cd "/Users/jaimeortiz/meta saas" && npx vercel --prod --yes
```

This ensures the production site stays in sync with the latest changes.

### Before Ending ANY Response

**Ask yourself:**
- Did I complete a task? → Update docs
- Did I make a decision? → Log in DECISIONS.md
- Did I learn something? → Log in LEARNINGS.md
- Is the HANDOVER.md current? → Update if not

---

## CRITICAL: Context Full - Handover Protocol

**When context is getting long (~40+ messages) or after completing a major milestone:**

1. **Update ALL docs with current state:**
   - `docs/PROGRESS.md` - What was completed this session
   - `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` - Exact stopping point
   - `docs/HANDOVER.md` - Full handover instructions
   - `docs/DECISIONS.md` - Any new decisions
   - `docs/LEARNINGS.md` - Any new learnings

2. **HANDOVER.md must include:**
   ```markdown
   ## Last Session Summary
   - What was completed
   - Files created/modified
   - Current state of the codebase

   ## Next Steps (Priority Order)
   1. Immediate next task
   2. Following tasks
   
   ## Blockers / Notes
   - Any issues encountered
   - Things to be aware of
   
   ## Commands to Run
   - Any setup commands for next session
   ```

3. **Tell the user:**
   > "**Context is getting full. Please open a new chat for fresh context.**
   > 
   > I've updated `docs/HANDOVER.md` with everything the next chat needs.
   > The next AI will pick up seamlessly from where we left off."

## CRITICAL: Before Writing ANY Code

**ALWAYS use MCP tools to research first:**

1. Use `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` then `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` for:
   - LangGraph.js patterns and latest API
   - Next.js 15 App Router patterns
   - Supabase auth and RLS patterns
   - shadcn/ui component usage

2. Use `web_search` for:
   - Latest API changes
   - Best practices for specific problems
   - Meta Marketing API documentation

3. Check `docs/DECISIONS.md` for past architectural choices
4. Check `docs/LEARNINGS.md` for known issues and solutions

**Never assume - always verify with MCP tools first.**

## Tech Stack Rules

### LangGraph.js 1.0
- Use `StateGraph` with proper `Annotation` definitions
- Use `PostgresSaver` from `@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` for production
- Use `ToolNode` from `@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt` for tool execution
- Implement human-in-the-loop with `interrupt()` for dangerous actions
- Always compile graph with checkpointer for persistence

### Next.js 15
- Use App Router exclusively (`app/` directory)
- Server Components by default
- Add `'use client'` only when absolutely necessary (hooks, browser APIs)
- Use Server Actions for data mutations
- Use Suspense boundaries for loading states
- Streaming responses for AI chat

### Supabase
- ALWAYS enable RLS on every table
- Wrap `auth.uid()` in `(select auth.uid())` for RLS performance
- Use `@supabase/ssr` for server-side authentication
- Generate TypeScript types from database
- Use Realtime for live updates in chat

### Meta Ads API
- Store access tokens encrypted in database
- Implement token refresh before expiry (check `token_expires_at`)
- Handle rate limits (check response headers)
- Use batch requests when fetching multiple objects
- Always validate with Zod before sending to API

### Meta OAuth (CRITICAL - ALWAYS LOGIN WITH META)
**Users ALWAYS sign in via Meta OAuth - NOT email/password.**

**Facebook App OAuth Settings (developers.facebook.com → Your App → Facebook Login → Settings):**
1. Enable "Client OAuth Login" = ON
2. Enable "Web OAuth Login" = ON
3. **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** - Add ALL of these:
   - `https://meta-ads-ai.vercel.app/api/auth/meta/callback` (main production domain)
   - `https://*.vercel.app/api/auth/meta/callback` (Vercel preview deployments - may need wildcard support)
   - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/meta/callback` (local development)

**If you get "URL Blocked" error:** The redirect URI is not whitelisted. Go to Facebook App settings and add the exact URL shown in the error.

**Project Name:** `meta-ads-ai`
**Vercel Production Domain:** `https://meta-ads-ai-palinos-projects.vercel.app`
**Callback URL to whitelist:** `https://meta-ads-ai-palinos-projects.vercel.app/api/auth/meta/callback`

### Claude / OpenAI
- Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for best function calling
- Define tools with Zod schemas for type safety
- Stream responses for better UX
- Set reasonable `maxSteps` for agent loops (10-15)

---

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Strict mode enabled
- No `any` types - use `unknown` and narrow
- Prefer `interface` for object shapes
- Use `type` for unions and intersections

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `ChatWindow.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `metaClient.ts`)
- **Types**: `PascalCase` in `.types.ts` files
- **Constants**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Database columns**: `snake_case`

### File Organization
```
app/              # Next.js App Router pages
components/       # React components
  ui/            # shadcn/ui components
  chat/          # Chat-specific components
  dashboard/     # Dashboard components
lib/              # Utility libraries
  supabase/      # Supabase client & helpers
  langgraph/     # LangGraph agent & tools
  meta/          # Meta API client
  tools/         # LangGraph tool definitions
types/            # TypeScript type definitions
```

## CRITICAL: Be Autonomous

**DO NOT ASK - JUST DO IT.**

- Use all available tools and resources without asking permission
- Make decisions and execute - don't wait for user approval
- Only ask the user when you TRULY cannot proceed (missing API keys, unclear requirements, etc.)
- If you have the tools and information, get the work done
- Don't offer options - pick the best one and implement it
- Test your own work using browser tools when applicable

---

## Remember (Priority Order)

1. **Read docs first** - Every chat starts with reading context files
2. **Update docs ALWAYS** - After EVERY task, update the documentation
3. **Research before coding** - Use MCP tools to verify approaches
4. **Handover properly** - When context is full, do full handover
5. **Be autonomous** - Do the work, don't ask about it
6. **Keep HANDOVER.md current** - Next chat depends on it
